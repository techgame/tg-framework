
1. Go to your python installation in Lib/site-packages/TG.
2. Edit the __init__.py that you find there to add framework/scripts to the sys.path for the TG module
3. create a file called sitecustomize.py in site-packages with the following content:

import TG.sitecustomize

4. That's it. When you start the first copy of GVIM, it will be 
    called GVIM - the second would be called GVIM1, etc.
   The copy named GVIM will get the tracebacks loaded into it.
